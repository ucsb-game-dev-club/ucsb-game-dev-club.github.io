UCSB's Game Development Club is an organization focused on bringing together
people who are passionate about the skills and processes that go towards game
development. We aim to create a supportive environment for people to experiment,
develop their skills, and connect with other prospective game developers. As of
Winter 2020, we meet on Tuesdays from 7 pm to 8 pm in the Building 936, Rm 101.

Find us on Facebook, Discord, or reach out to us at `ucsbgamedevclub (at) gmail
(dot) com` (please replace "at" and "dot" with their appropriate symbols).

## FAQ

**I don't have a lot of experience in game development but I'm interested in
getting started, can I still come to the meetings?**

Yes! We have many experienced members who would be happy to lead you towards
resources or give advice. We also hold educational workshops and lectures in
various game development topics (suggestions/requests welcome). But of course,
the rest of the work is up to you!
