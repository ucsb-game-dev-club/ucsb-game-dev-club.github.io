    Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Khari! I&amp;rsquo;ve been an on and off game programmer since I was 7, and I

<p>focus primarily on how the rules of a game shape how it’s played. I’m influenced
by game design analysts like Mark Brown and Cagey Videos; some games I admire
include Left 4 Dead (2), Rocket League, and Foddy’s Get On Top. My mission as a
GDC Specialist is to get club members to make whatever game you can, with
whatever time you have!
